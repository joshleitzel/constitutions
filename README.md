This is a repository of world constitutions in Markdown format.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a central repository of world constitutions in a common format (Markdown), which can be easily converted into other formats such as XML and PDF. I am currently working my way through the constitutions alphabetically; initially I want to provide quality versions of the texts from reputable (ideally official, e.g. national gazettes) sources. Eventually I plan to include all the constitutions in both their original language (which is often difficult to find online in a convenient format) and in translation to English.

It might also be interesting to eventually include constitutions that are no longer in use, non-national constitutions (e.g., the constitutions of the various states of the U.S.), and related non-constitutional documents (e.g., the U.N. Charter on Human Rights, the U.S. Federalist Papers).

Pull requests will be entertained!
