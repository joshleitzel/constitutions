This is a repository of world constitutions in Markdown format.

## Goals

Initially the plan is to provide English-language copies of the constitutions that are actively in use today. Eventually, I want to provide original (untranslated) versions of all the text, which is often difficult to find in an easily convertible format. It might also be interesting to eventually include constitutions that are no longer in use, non-national constitutions (e.g., the constitutions of the various states of the U.S.), and related non-constitutional documents (e.g., the U.N. Charter on Human Rights, the U.S. Federalist Papers).

I'm currently proceeding alphabetically through the countries with constitutions currently in use (list below). If you want to help, do so and make a pull request!
