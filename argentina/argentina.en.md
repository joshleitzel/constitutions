#### Article 24
Congress shall promote the reform of the present legislation in all its branches, and the establishment of trial by jury.

The principles, guarantees and rights recognized in the preceding sections shall not be modified by the laws that regulate their enforcement.

#### Article 29
Congress may not vest on the National Executive Power—nor may the provincial legislatures vest on the provincial governors—extraordinary powers or the total public authority; it may not grant acts of submission or supremacy whereby the life, honor, or wealth of the Argentine people will be at the mercy of governments or any person whatsoever. Acts of this nature shall be utterly void, and shall render those who formulate them, consent to them or sign them, liable to be condemned as infamous traitors to their fatherland.

#### Article 31
This Constitution, the laws of the Nation enacted by Congress in pursuance thereof, and treaties with foreign powers, are the supreme law of the Nation; and the authorities of each province are bound thereby, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary included in the provincial laws or constitutions, except for the province of Buenos Aires, the treaties ratified after the Pact of November 11, 1859.

#### Article 32
The Federal Congress shall not enact laws restricting the freedom of the press or establishing federal jurisdiction over it.

#### Article 33
The declarations, rights and guarantees which the Constitution enumerates shall not be construed as a denial of other rights and guarantees not enumerated, but rising from the principle of sovereignty of the people and from the republican form of government.

#### Article 34
The judges of the federal courts cannot at the same time hold an office in the provincial courts. The federal service, whether civil or military, shall not grant a right of residence in the province in which it is performed unless it is where the employee habitually resides, this provision being understood as pertaining to the right to choose employments in the province in which he accidentally happens to be.

#### Article 35
The denominations successively adopted from 1810 up to the present, namely: “United Provinces of the River Plate”; “Argentine Republic”; “Argentine Confederation”, shall henceforth be official names to be indistinctly used for the designation of the government and territory of the provinces, the words “Argentine Nation” being used in the making and enactment of laws.

## Chapter II: New Rights and Guarantees
#### Article 36
This Constitution shall rule even when its observance is interrupted by acts of force against the institutional order and the democratic system. These acts shall be irreparably null.

Their authors shall be punished with the penalty foreseen in Article 29, disqualified in perpetuity from holding public offices and excluded from the benefits of pardon and commutation of sentences.
